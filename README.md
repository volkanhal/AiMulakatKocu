\# 🚀 AI-Powered Interview Simulation System



> \*\*An intelligent system designed to automate technical interview processes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM).\*\*



\## 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a real-world technical interview experience. By analyzing the candidate's CV and technical background, the AI generates context-aware questions and evaluates the candidate's responses in real-time.



It serves as the \*\*MVP (Minimum Viable Product)\*\* for a startup initiative focused on HR Tech solutions.



\## ⚡ Key Features

\* \*\*Dynamic Question Generation:\*\* Generates unique questions based on the user's tech stack (Python, C#, etc.).

\* \*\*CV Analysis:\*\* Parses resumes to tailor the interview context using NLP techniques.

\* \*\*Real-time Feedback:\*\* Provides instant scoring and improvement suggestions for candidate answers.

\* \*\*Sentiment Analysis:\*\* Evaluates the confidence level of the candidate during the simulation.



\## 🛠️ Tech Stack \& Architecture

\* \*\*Core:\*\* Python 3.12+

\* \*\*AI/NLP:\*\* OpenAI API (or Local LLM), Pandas, NumPy

\* \*\*Backend:\*\* RESTful API Design (Scalable Architecture)

\* \*\*Version Control:\*\* Git \& GitHub
